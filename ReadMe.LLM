# SDD Specs – LLM Guide

Compact orientation for AI and spec-writing assistants in this repository.

## 1. Scope and Constraints
- This repo is **spec-only**: SDD-style specs, profiles, bundles, schemas, and helper tools.
- No implementation code, build scripts, or runtime configuration live here.
- Specs are implementation‑neutral and technology‑agnostic; concrete stacks belong in profiles or downstream repos.

## 2. Repository Layout
- `specs/` – spec units (each a directory with `spec.yaml`, `spec.md`, optional `examples/`, `profiles/`, and `open-questions.md`).
- `bundles/` – composition bundles that group specs and profiles.
- `catalog/` – indices for specs, profiles, and bundles; must stay consistent with `specs/` and `bundles/`.
- `schemas/` – JSON Schemas for validating specs, profiles, and bundles.
- `tools/` – small, focused validation/lint helpers only.
- `docs/` – vision, SDD principles, style/authoring guides, and this repo’s constitution and gates.

## 3. Spec Workflow (SDD)
- Start from `specs/_template-spec-unit/` when creating a new spec unit.
- Treat `spec.yaml` (and any referenced bundles) as the **normative** definition; treat `spec.md` as narrative that must not contradict it.
- Keep catalogs under `catalog/` in sync whenever specs, profiles, or bundles are added, moved, or deprecated.
- For substantial spec changes, run the **Spec Analysis Gate** in `docs/spec-analysis-gate.md` (or at least mentally walk through it).

## 4. Open Questions (Per Spec)
- Each spec unit maintains its own `open-questions.md` (seeded from the template).
- Use it only for **currently open** medium/high-impact questions about that spec.
- When a question is resolved, first update `spec.yaml`, bundles, and any normative sections in `spec.md`, then remove the row from `open-questions.md`.
- Question IDs (for example `Q-001`) are local to that spec and chat; do not reference them from catalogs or other global docs.

## 5. Useful References
- Repo constitution: `docs/specs-constitution.md`
- SDD principles: `docs/sdd-principles.md`
- Style guide: `docs/style-guide.md`
- Authoring guidelines: `docs/authoring-guidelines.md`
- Spec template: `specs/_template-spec-unit/`

## 6. Expectations for Agents
- Read the relevant spec unit and key docs before editing: `spec.yaml`, `spec.md`, examples/bundles, constitution, SDD principles, and style/authoring guides.
- Prefer concrete, small diffs that keep specs, bundles, and catalogs aligned.
- Do not introduce implementation details, build commands, or environment configs; those live in downstream implementation repos that consume these specs.

## 7. Session Handover / Handoff Template

When the human asks for a “session handover” (or “handoff”), prepare a copy/paste‑ready prompt for the next assistant using this template and fill in as many brackets as you can from repo context. The reply to the human MUST wrap the entire handover text in a single fenced code block (for example, ```text … ```), so it can be pasted into a new session unchanged.

```
You’re resuming work on [spec/bundle/catalog identifier or short workstream name]. Core context:

- Environment: repo at [path], spec-only (no implementation code). Validation helpers: `./tools/validate-specs.sh`, `./tools/validate-bundles.sh`. Follow `AGENTS.md`, `docs/specs-constitution.md`, `docs/sdd-principles.md`, `docs/style-guide.md`, and `docs/authoring-guidelines.md`.
- Current status: active spec unit(s) […], profiles/bundles […], catalog entries […]. Spec Analysis Gate: [done/pending; link to `docs/spec-analysis-gate.md` or notes].
- Recent increments: [brief bullet list of the last completed increments in this repo, noting key specs/bundles/catalog files touched and their outcomes].
- Pending scope: [next planned edits], including open questions per spec (`open-questions.md` paths and IDs), required catalog updates, and any bundle/profile alignment work.
- Git state: [branch], staged files [list or “clean”], outstanding TODOs [if any].
- Next steps you should take now: [ordered checklist, e.g., “1. Update spec.yaml for … 2. Align spec.md narrative … 3. Update bundles/catalog … 4. Run validation scripts …”].
- Reminders: keep increments small and spec-focused, avoid introducing implementation details, keep catalogs and bundles in sync with specs, run `./tools/validate-specs.sh` and `./tools/validate-bundles.sh` before finalising work, and clear or update `open-questions.md` entries once decisions are reflected in normative artefacts.
```

Use this template as the backbone of any “session handover” response so successors inherit a consistent, high-signal summary.
