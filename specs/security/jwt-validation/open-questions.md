# Open Questions – JWT Validation

Use this file **only** to capture currently open medium- or high-impact questions
for this spec unit. It is a **temporary scratchpad for open questions**, not a
permanent record of decisions.

Hard rules:

- This table may only contain rows whose status is `Open`.
- When a question is resolved, its outcome **must be captured in the spec’s
  normative artefacts** (`spec.yaml`, supporting bundles, and/or normative
  sections in `spec.md`), and the corresponding row **must be deleted** from
  this file.
- Resolved questions **must not be archived** in this file; remove any details
  when the row is removed.
- Question IDs (for example `Q-001`) are **local to this spec unit and chat
  transcripts** and **must never be referenced from catalogs or other
  repository-global docs**. Authoritative documents must stand on their own
  without pointing back here.
- This file is **never** a source of truth; once a question is resolved, this
  file should contain no remaining record of it.

<!-- Add new rows below with Status set to Open only. Remove the row once resolved and documented elsewhere. -->

| ID | Owner | Question | Options (A preferred) | Status | Asked | Notes |
