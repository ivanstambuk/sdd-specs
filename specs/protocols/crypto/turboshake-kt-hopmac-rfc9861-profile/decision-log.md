# Decision Log – TurboSHAKE / KangarooTwelve / HopMAC RFC 9861 Profile

This file is **non-normative**. It records resolved design questions and
decisions for this spec unit, together with short rationales and stable local
IDs. It complements, but does not replace, the normative artefacts:

- `spec.yaml`
- `spec.md`
- `profile-spec.md`
- `profile-core.yaml`
- `conformance.yaml`

Normative behavior and conformance remain defined solely by those artefacts and
by the external standards they reference (RFC 9861, FIPS 202). This file
exists to help future readers understand **why** specific choices were made.

## How to use this log

- Each decision entry gets a local ID `D-xxx` (for example, `D-001`), scoped to
  this spec unit.
- Normative specs **may** refer to these IDs in non-critical commentary
  (e.g., “see decision D-001 for rationale”), but must not depend on this file
  to define behavior.
- When a decision is revised in a later version of the profile:
  - Add a new entry with a new ID describing the updated decision.
  - Keep the previous entry, marking it as superseded and pointing to the new
    ID.
